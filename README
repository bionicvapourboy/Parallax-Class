 INFORMATION
====================================================================


 * Import the class like this:

   parallax = require( "parallax" )


 * To create a new scene

   yourScene = parallax.newScene(
		{
			width = [X SCENE SIZE],
			height = [Y SCENE SIZE],
			left = [SCENE X BEGINNING POS],
			top = [SCENE Y BEGINNING POS],
			[infinite = [REPEAT FOREVER, TRUE/FALSE]
		} )


 * To add a new layer to the scene

   yourScene:newLayer(
		{
			image = [IMAGE NAME],
			width = [IMAGE WIDTH],
			height = [IMAGE HEIGHT],
			top = [IMAGE Y POS],
			left = [IMAGE X POS],
			[speed = [HOW FAST, 0 - 1 for backgrounds, > 1 for foregrounds]],
			[repeated = [INF SCROLL, TRUE/FALSE]]
		} )

 NOTE: Create your layers in order from closest to farthest away


 * To add objects to a layer

   yourScene:insertObj( object, [layer] )

 NOTE: If no layer specified, defaults to the top layer
        From top back they are numbered 1 to # of Layers


 * To move a scene

   yourScene:move( deltaX, deltaY )
